# Project Overview

This section provides a comprehensive overview of our Go HTTP Server project, including its architecture, goals, and implementation details.

## Architecture

The server is built using Go's standard library with the following key components:

- **HTTP Router**: `http.NewServeMux()` for request routing
- **Handler Functions**: Modular functions for each endpoint
- **JSON Encoding**: Built-in JSON marshaling for API responses
- **In-Memory Storage**: Simple slice-based data storage

## Project Goals

- **Learning**: Demonstrate basic HTTP server concepts in Go
- **Simplicity**: Clean, readable code for educational purposes  
- **RESTful Design**: Follow REST API conventions
- **JSON API**: Provide structured JSON responses
- **CORS Support**: Enable frontend integration

## Technology Stack

- **Language**: Go (Golang)
- **HTTP Server**: Go standard library (`net/http`)
- **Data Format**: JSON
- **Storage**: In-memory (slice)
- **Documentation**: Hugo with Book theme
